# Cannabis Storymap

Student research project.
The aim of the project was to collect, analyse and visualise health-related data within 4 days.
As a prerequisite, the data must have a geographical reference.

We focused on cannabis use in the USA and compared it with the use of other drugs or the number of crimes.
